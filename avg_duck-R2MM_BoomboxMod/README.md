## BoomboxMod for R2ModMan
Allows the user to individually hide the music text and timer text on the in-game boombox HUD.\
Adjustable using ModMenu or the config file.
Compatible with Glomzubuk's StageAsMusicName mod.

Idea from Daioutzu's LLBModManager version of the mod.
Improved to have config options for quick toggling in ModMenu and call the hiding logic only once each time a screen transition happens instead of once every frame.
